! !ROUTINE: next_observation_pdaf --- Initialize information on next observation
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE next_observation_pdaf(stepnow, nsteps, doexit, time)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! User-supplied routine for PDAF.
! Used in the filters: SEEK/SEIK/EnKF/LSEIK/ETKF/LETKF/ESTKF/LESTKF
!
! The subroutine is called before each forecast phase
! by PDAF\_get\_state. It has to initialize the number 
! of time steps until the next available observation 
! (nsteps) and the current model time (time). In 
! addition the exit flag (exit) has to be initialized.
! It indicates if the data assimilation process is 
! completed such that the ensemble loop in the model 
! routine can be exited.
!
! The routine is called by all processes. 
!
! !REVISION HISTORY:
! 2013-09 - Lars Nerger - Initial code
! Later revisions - see svn log
